This problem is known as the “Unique Paths” problem: Let’s say you have
a grid of rows and columns. Write a function that accepts a number of rows
and a number of columns, and calculates the number of possible “shortest”
paths from the upper-leftmost square to the lower-rightmost square.
For example, here’s what the grid looks like with three rows and seven
columns. You want to get from the “S” (Start) to the “F” (Finish).

|S| | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | |F| 
*/


const numberOfPaths = (rows, columns) => {
  
  if (rows === 1 || columns === 1) return 1;
 
  return (numberOfPaths(columns - 1, rows) + numberOfPaths(columns, rows - 1));   
}

console.log(numberOfPaths(7, 3))
