If we perform breadth-first search on the previous graph starting with the
“A” vertex, what is the order in which we’ll traverse all the vertices?
Assume that when given the choice to visit multiple adjacent vertices,
we’ll first visit the node that is earliest in the alphabet.


ANSWER: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P (the alphabet order)
